Players are proposed to search for a missing mayor in Heyholn by a tavernkeeper. It is a paid order, so they will be compensated with gold. The order was sent secretly by the mayor as he feared that falsehydra will get him.

As players arrive, nobody knows the mayor, nobody's heard of him. However, they can find written evidence of his existence. The town looks half-abandoned and many houses were never lived in.

The inn that players stop at does not have innkeepers as they've gone missing.

In the end, players discover a false hydra, a creature that controls minds by singing and when it consumes its meal, all living memory of it is destroyed.

As players celebrate their victory, a bigger threat awakens. An archfey kept imprisoned under the city, guarded by the hydra. In reality, the archfey entered people's minds to free herself, but the hydra would kill them before the archfey breaks out. With the magic gone, archfey wants revenge on those who imprisoned her for so long -- the Seelie Court. Players can face her or die.

The story under covers -- the archfey once fell in love with a bard, but he planned to learn her true name and use an artifact of his design to consume her essence. However, enraged, she destroyed him and all living memories of him, including her own. But the hole in her heart and the feeling of betrayal remains. These powerful emotions gave birth to the hydra. Both were banished from the Feywild by the Seelie Court. 

When defeated, Gambaridze appears again and consumes archfey essence -- the power of illusion and entering minds. Players can choose to fight him, but are expected to be exhausted.
