As the [[Lunara]] is freed from her imprisonment, she is on track to punish the mortals who slayed her child. Even though the players freed her, she still resents them for what they did to [[False Hydra]].
## Phase 1: Nightmare
> [!info] Music
> [[Index#Blood Starved Beast]] (Saitoh, T., 2015)

The players are dreaming. They feel tight, squeezed, in the dark. Suddenly, the light breaks through the walls as the ceiling tears apart. Players find themselves on a palm of [[Lunara]]. She appears to be gigantic.

> [[Player Questionnaire#Nightmare]]

She casts [weird](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/weird), but without the restriction of area as the players cannot leave the palm. The nightmare can start as shared, but continues as individual. It is possible for players to help each other after they successfully defeat the nightmare.

> [!tip]
> Design the nightmare in advanced, based on the player's answers. There is big potential to create strong emotions of it.
> > [!example]
> > Players stated that their characters' (A and B) fear to loose their party. Another player stated, that their character (C) fears to meet her sister, who became a monstrosity, as the character did not find a way to cure her yet and will have to kill. 
> > 
> > In this situation, the nightmare could be the sister of C, that scares her immediately. A and B see C being slaughtered, triggering their fear.

Once the nightmares are defeated, the encounter continues.

## Aftermath
> [!info] Music
> [[Index#Bittersweet]] (Silantyev, D.V., 2018b)

When [[Lunara]] is defeated, she may take a few moments to express her surprise. She may share pieces of her past.

Suddenly, a powerful sound and an earth tremble break the aftermath of the battle. All players are prone. [[Lunara]] is bound to listen to what's its source has to say.

Then, in a matter of seconds, [[Lunara]] is sucked in an amulet as she was sand. The janitor, who is in fact [[Gambaridze]], appears to have captured her. He offers players a just reward for their travel, but to ask no further questions.
## Gambaridze (Not Recommended)
If PCs attack Gambaridze, he uses +12 for initiative. As soon as he is able to, he teleports to his lair, that has a permanent teleportation circle. If any of the PCs goes first, he uses "Psychic Scream" as a legendary action after PC's turn.
