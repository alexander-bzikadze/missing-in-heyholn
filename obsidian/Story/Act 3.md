As the [[Lunara]] is freed from her imprisonment, she is on track to punish the mortals who slayed her child. Even though PCs freed her, she still resents them for what they did to [[False Hydra]].

> [[Index#Blood Starved Beast]] (Saitoh, T., 2015)

PCs are dreaming. They feel tight, squeezed, in the dark. Suddenly, the light breaks through the walls as the ceiling tears apart. PCs find themselves on a palm of [[Lunara]]. She appears to be gigantic.

She casts [weird](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/weird), but without the restriction of area as the PCs cannot leave the palm. The nightmare can start as shared, but continues as individual. It is possible for PCs to help each other after they successfully defeat the nightmare.

> [!tip]
> Design the nightmare in advanced, based on the player's answers. There is big potential to create strong emotions of it.
> > [!example]
> > PCs (A and B) have a fear to loose their party. Another PC (C) fears to meet her sister, who became a monstrosity, as the character did not find a way to cure her yet and will have to kill. 
> > 
> > In this situation, the nightmare could be the sister of C, that scares her immediately. A and B see C being slaughtered, triggering their fear.

Once the nightmares are defeated, the encounter continues.

> [[Index#Bittersweet]] (Silantyev, D.V., 2018b)

When [[Lunara]] is defeated, she may take a few moments to express her surprise. She may share pieces of her past.

Suddenly, a powerful sound and an earth tremble break the aftermath of the battle. All PCs are prone. [[Lunara]] is bound to listen to what's its source has to say.

Then, in a matter of seconds, [[Lunara]] is sucked in an amulet as she was sand. The janitor, who is in fact [[Gambaridze]], appears to have captured her. He offers PCs a just reward for their travel, but to ask no further questions.
## Gambaridze (Not Recommended)
If PCs attack Gambaridze, he uses +12 for initiative. As soon as he is able to, he teleports to his lair, that has a permanent teleportation circle. If any of the PCs goes first, he uses "Psychic Scream" as a legendary action after PC's turn.
