PCs arrive at Heyholn. They are greeted by a small-sized town with stone houses, many of which a abandoned and in ruins. Surprisingly, the townsfolk seem to ignore it all together, just going by their daily lives as nothing is out of order.

PCs are met by an innboy [[Kim]]. He hastily invites them to the inn, as if he was afraid of competition. If asked, he stumbles as there is no other active inn in the city.

Surprisingly, nobody knows any mayor, they never had one since previous one died ten years ago.
## [[Pour Yourself]] Inn (0.5h)
> [!info] Music
> [[Index#Marble Machine]] (Wintergatan, 2016)

When player's arrive at the inn, there is no staff but [[Kim]] and an automaton [[Gearheart]]. The tavern hall is on self-service policy: all the patrons pay and pour ale by themselves -- it is all automated. Whenever something is broken or spilled, an automaton cleans it. The automaton also cooks standard meals in a slow cooker.

> [!tip]
> [[Gearheart]] does remember the owners, but can only say that they are missing. In their absence the owner is [[Kim]].

[[Borgin Silentstone]] cannot communicate with the player's directly, but can try through gestures. [[Boy]] will also come to the tavern to find PCs.
## Investigation
PCs can search two locations in order to find out what happened to the mayor [[Eldric Baneswood]]: townhall or his house.
### [[Townhall]] (1.5h)

> [[Index#House of Blossoms]] (St-Pierre, L., 2014)

> [!tip]
> Everybody knows, where the townhall is.

Despite the absence of mayor, his assistant [[Corin Swiftgale]] is working in the townhall. Along side him, the building is maintained by a janitor ([[Gambaridze]]), a mystery wise man. The townhall has multiple rooms, but most notable are
- mayor's office
- mayor waiting room / assistant's office
- council chambers
- town library

The janitor does not reveal much of the information, he is mostly consumed with cleaning, though he appears not to be making a good job of it as the whole building is in half-ruin, spider web and dust.
> [!note] Check
> Perception DC 30 reveals, the janitor pays close attention to PCs.

> [!tip]
> [[Gambaridze]] is fully aware of PCs intentions and mayor's discoveries. Each evening he writes down everything he saw in case he forgets.
#### Assistant's Office
> [!tip]
> [[Corin Swiftgale]] complains that anybody can walk in to his office because the door is broken, but there is nobody in the town to fix it. Never was.

The assistant is mostly concerned with accounting, making sure that the town pays taxes on time. He does complain that it would be easier if they had a mayor.

> [!tip]
> [[Corin Swiftgale]] assumes PCs came to pay taxes, but does not recognize them.

From the [[Corin Swiftgale]]'s office, PCs can reach mayor's office, but they need to convince Corin to give out the key or break in.

> [!note] Check
> Group stealth DC 20 will not draw [[Corin Swiftgale]]'s attention.

> [!note]

#### Mayor's Office
Mayor office has clear indications of mayor existence and the fact, that he conducted an investigation. 

> [!note] Check
> Investigation or perception DC 20 will reveal a wooden board with mayor's investigation materials, facing the wall.

His board reveals:
- proof that people disappear without a trace.
- observations that people's memories disappear, but not the writings.
- description of the order

> [!tip]
> At some point mayor starts mentioning _it_, without specifying it.
#### Council Chambers
Nothing important in here, half-in-ruin. PCs can use it as a war room.
#### Town Library
> [!tip]

It is a small two-stores house: cabinet/kitchen on the first, second is bedroom.
> [!note] Check

Dorian's diary in a poetic manner reveals:
* His plan to seduce [[Lunara]].
* The diary clearly mentions _the device_, but without description.
* The diary has clear indications of removed pages.

> [!tip]
> The diary is in Elvish.

In the bedroom, PCs find ropes and shackles: [[Eldric Baneswood]] tried to bind himself each night. They are torn, broken with clear signs of something dragging someone out of the window.
