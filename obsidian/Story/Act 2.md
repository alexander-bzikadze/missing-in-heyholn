## The Hunt
> [!info] Music
> [[Index#Swamps]] (Jarlestam, P. 2021)

They need to search the swamp, but in general survival DC 15 should find the layer. The terrain in the swamp is considered **difficult**. The surroundings are decaying, dying. Nothing can survive here, a lot of animal and human bones lay around as if they were gathered for centuries. The sound of cracking bones under water emits with every step.

If players approach without concealing themselves, the hydra will attempt to ambush them. For a successful surprise, it needs to roll higher than passive perception of the party.

Once players find [[False Hydra]], the encounter awaits. It follows the following broadly defined stages:
1. Initial contact, in which the false hydra will try to disconnect the PCs from one another.
2. Attempt to engulf the weakest or deadliest opponent. For that it must move several of its heads to repeatedly attack.
3. Once the false hydra is left with only two heads, it will attempt an escape while its severed heads come back to life and attack PCs. To escape, it will need to move 20 feet towards water.

```encounter-table
name: "Hydra's body"
creatures:
  - 1: False Hydra
  - 7: False Hydra's Head
---
name: "Hydra's escape"
creatures:
  - 1: Severed False Hydra's Head
```

## Aftermath
- False Hydra's blood can be used to create "Forgetfulness Potion".
- It's gas and spit can be used to create "Mirror Image Potion".
- It's lymph can be used to create "Oil of Nightmares".
When the False Hydra is dead, the swamp immediately starts growing back as it comes back to life.

When PCs are down and sleeping, they share a dream of broken chains and Lunara's laughter. Without leaving the dream, act 3 starts.
