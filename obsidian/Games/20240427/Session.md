## Post Game Ideas
- ~~Kim should not wake up on the second night~~
- ~~Hydra should grapple on a successful attack, as proposed in the original~~
	- ~~As an action, hydra's head can restrain grapple opponent~~
- ~~Hydra can grow its AC as the battle progresses~~
- ~~Hydra's heads can go under water, hide and move faster~~
- ~~Lunara should get more spells, including shield and counterspell~~
- ~~Lunara is good with 330 of health~~
- ~~Lunara's legendary scream of pain should become available if she receives more than 50 points of damage per round~~
