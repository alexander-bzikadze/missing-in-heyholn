## Beleanor
Beleanor is a astral elf navigator, believer of Celestian. His ship crashed and now he is continuing his journey through Faerun. He wants to learn more about this world until Celestian shows him the way back home.
## Gaddock
Bastard son of a lord's wife, Gaddock was born as a result of an Orcish assault on the castle. His mother died giving birth to him, depriving the lord of his most precious love.  Unable to look at Gaddock, he sent him to be raised by the castle blacksmith.

When blacksmith died, the lord decided to accept Gaddock to the castle as he was still his mother's son and a reminder of her to the lord. Gaddock's formal position became of a servant, but he was educated and treated well by everybody. He also has grown to be incontinent in social interactions and tends to rely on Nel to make decisions.

When Nel's sister turned to a werewolf and slayed most of the castle tenants, Gaddock dragged frozen Nel out of the castle and saved her. When they met bloodhunters after that, he was influenced to accept hunt's bane and became a mutant monster hunter.
## Nel (Il\`rysll√¶n Athiri Sylsarann)
Gaddock's secret half sister, firstborn child of the castle lord. He was raised in a good, loving environment and became close friends with Gaddock when he was accepted to the castle.

Because of her close friendship with Gaddock, her sister has grown jealous. She researched old books to strike a bargain with out-world entities and by accident contacted Malar. Asking him to become strikingly beautiful, he turned her into his own understanding of beauty: a werewolf. She ended up slaughtering the whole castle.

Nel feels guity that she did not stop Gaddock from becoming a mutant and for never telling him about her sister. She also searches for the cure for her sister, but is afraid to find her sooner.
