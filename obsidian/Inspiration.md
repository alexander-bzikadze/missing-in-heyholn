Not drawing on details directly, but I want to create a story that would allow players to prepare for a big encounter: learning about their opponent, about their weaknesses and strengths, how to best prepare themselves.

That opens the road the Blood Hunter / Order of the Mutant and need to learn how mutagens and potions work.
