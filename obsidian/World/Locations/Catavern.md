Nestled on the road between Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate, "Catavern" stands as a unique sanctuary for adventurers and cat lovers alike. Run by a retired ranger adventurer whose love for cats knows no bounds, the tavern is a haven where several dozen felines roam freely, mingling with patrons in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The walls, adorned with relics of the tavernkeeper's adventurous past, tell tales of distant lands and fierce battles, while the soft purring of cats adds a soothing backdrop to the tales of yore.

The tavern spans two stories, with a large hall on the ground floor capable of hosting gatherings of 40-50 people. Here, under the warm glow of lantern light, guests can be found enjoying hearty meals and ale, their laughter and conversation mingling with the contented mews of cats lounging on window sills or weaving between legs. The air is filled with the aroma of roasted meats and fresh bread, and every so often, a curious cat hops onto a lap, seeking affection or perhaps a morsel of food.

Upstairs, the Catavern offers accommodations for up to 24 guests in cozy, comfortable rooms. Each room, named after a legendary cat from folklore, provides a peaceful retreat from the day's adventures. As night falls, the tavern's cats often choose their favorite guests to snuggle with, offering their purring companionship until dawn. The Catavern, with its unique blend of hospitality and feline charm, has become a beloved stop for travelers seeking rest, adventure, and the company of cats.
