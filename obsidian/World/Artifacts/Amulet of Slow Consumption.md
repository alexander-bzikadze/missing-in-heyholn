> Designed by the ambitious elf [[Dorian]], the Amulet of Slow Consumption is a deceptively elegant artifact that traps and assimilates creatures' essences, granting the wearer their powers.

Creator: [[Dorian]]
## Background 
The Amulet of Slow Consumption is the magnum opus of the elven artificer [[Dorian]], a manifestation of his ambition and intellect. The amulet requires the knowledge of a creature's true name to function. Its creation was motivated by Dorian's desire to ascend beyond his mortal confines and to exercise control over the very essence of life and magic.
## Powers
The amulet possesses the ability to ensnare, contain, and consume the essence of any creature whose true name is known to the wielder. Once a creature is locked within the amulet, its powers and abilities are slowly transferred to the host, allowing them to wield a fraction of the captured being's might. This process of consumption is gradual, ensuring the host can acclimate to their newly acquired powers without being overwhelmed. The amulet's design is such that if correctly crafted and utilized, it can bestow upon the wearer capabilities akin to those of demons, archfey, or even gods, making it an object of immense power and danger.
## Appearance
The Amulet of Slow Consumption is deceptively simple in appearance, belying its potent capabilities. Crafted from an alloy that gleams with an otherworldly light, the amulet features a central gem that pulsates with a soft, captivating glow, reminiscent of a heart beating in the dark. The metalwork around the gem is intricate, adorned with symbols and inscriptions that hint at the amulet's true nature and purpose. These runes are not merely decorative but are integral to the artifact's function, each meticulously etched to channel and harness the arcane energies necessary for the amulet's operation.
