Born into a lineage celebrated for their mastery of magic and artifice, Dorian's dreams always soared beyond the achievements of his ancestors.

He is driven by a complex mixture of altruistic ideals and a deep-seated desire for control and adoration. Dorian views himself as a savior, destined to elevate his subjects to eternal happiness, yet his methods reveal a darker inclination towards domination and sacrifice. His brilliance as an artificer is only matched by his ambition, making him a dangerous individual who is willing to cross ethical boundaries for his perceived greater good.

His hands, always moving, betray an incessant need to tinker and improve upon his creations. He dresses in attire that balances the traditional elegance of elven culture with the practical needs of his work as an artificer, adorned with tools and gadgets of his own design.
