## Biography
Corin Swiftgale has long served as the assistant to Mayor [[Eldric Baneswood]] of Heyholn, handling the day-to-day operations with a diligence that belies his true ambitions. Born into a family of modest means, Corin always dreamed of a life beyond the administrative duties assigned to him, especially harboring a deep-seated desire to master the arcane arts. Despite his position, he found himself kept at arm's length from the mayor's most confidential endeavors, a decision stemming from Eldric's intuition about Corin's distracted, dream-filled gaze towards the magical.
## Character
Corin possesses a light-hearted and optimistic nature, often seen with a smile and a quick jest, yet his eyes betray a yearning for something more. His fascination with magic is no secret in Heyholn, leading to his reputation as a daydreamer amongst the townsfolk. This same fascination, however, has driven him to quietly study the arcane in his spare time, using his position to gather any books or scrolls that pass through the town. Despite the mayor's reservations, Corin remains loyal, albeit feeling underutilized and dreaming of proving his worth beyond mere administrative tasks.

He dresses in the practical attire of a civil servant, though often with one or two items that hint at his magical aspirationsâ€”be it an intricately patterned scarf or a ring that looks too ornate for his station. His workspace is cluttered with official documents, alongside a hidden drawer filled with arcane tomes and scrolls.
