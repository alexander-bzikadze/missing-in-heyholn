## Biography
Alastar Gambaridze is a figure cloaked in mystery and intrigue. Tales whisper of his years at the Baldur's Gate academy, where he fine-tuned his skills in magic and melody. His journey took a darker turn when he ventured into Avernus, facing Zariel, the archdevil ruling the first layer of the Nine Hells. 

In his journeys, he found [[Dorian's Diary]]. He used it to recreate the [[Amulet of Slow Consumption]] and decided to use it as originally intended against [[Lunara]]. Able to resist both [[False Hydra]] and [[Lunara]] to control him with the use of the crown of mental resistance.

In Heyholn, he appears as a janitor of the [[Townhall]]. However, he is not what he seems. He was the one to throw [[Dorian's Diary]] to [[Eldric Baneswood]] table and softly guided him with vague advises. He has a magic diary that records everything he wants at will, allowing him to track records in case [[False Hydra]] causes him to forget.

Despite these formidable experiences, Gambaridze keeps his past tightly sealed, letting few beyond the veil of his secrets.
