## Biography

Lunara, a dreamwalker of the Feywild, finds joy in weaving through the dreams of mortals, granting their wishes within the ephemeral realms of their slumber. Known for her benevolent heart and whimsical nature, she embodies the essence of capricious fey magic, touching lives with gentle dreams and hopes. However, her light-hearted demeanor masks a depth of emotion and power, for when betrayed, Lunara reveals a darker aspect of her being. She then harnesses her dreamwalking ability not to enchant, but to awaken the deepest fears in those who wrong her, a testament to her complex nature as an archfey.

[[Dorian]] seduced her and, after gaining her trust, learnt her true name. When he attempted to confine her to [[Amulet of Slow Consumption]], she resisted and defeated Dorian. Angry, she removed him from existence and from all living memories, giving birth to [[False Hydra]]. In light of this crime she was determined by other archfeys to be forever locked in the mortal realm, guarded by its monster. She consistently attempts to enter mortal minds to escape, but those mortals are hunted by [[False Hydra]]
## Character
Lunara's personality is a study in contrasts. In moments of kindness, she is the embodiment of the joy and wonder found in dreams, her actions guided by a desire to bring happiness. Her good-hearted nature, however, is balanced by a fierce protectiveness of her realm and a swift change to capricious wrath when faced with betrayal. This duality makes her both a cherished ally and a fearsome enemy, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the Feywild itself. Despite her powers and the fear she can inspire, Lunara seeks understanding and connection, driven by a love for the beauty of dreams and the potential for goodness in all beings.
## Appearance
Lunara possesses an ethereal beauty that shifts with the whims of her mood and the dreams she visits. Her appearance is ever-changing, often reflecting the themes of the dreams she walks within. In moments of benevolence, she may appear radiant, her form adorned with luminescent, soft hues that echo the tranquility of the dreamworld. When angered, her visage may darken, mirroring the nightmarish visions she invokes, with eyes that glimmer with an unsettling light. Regardless of her form, Lunara always carries an aura of otherworldly grace, her presence a reminder of the powerful, wild magic of the Feywild.

## Voice
Lunara's voice is as mutable as her appearance, ranging from the comforting whisper of a bedtime tale to the eerie echo of a forgotten fear. Her words can weave captivating stories that bring dreams to life, filled with warmth and wonder. Yet, when her wrath is stirred, her voice becomes a chilling wind, capable of invoking a primal fear with each syllable. Speaking with Lunara is to be reminded of the dual nature of dreams: they can offer refuge and hope, but also hold shadows and terrors, all at the whim of the dreamwalker.
