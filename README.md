# Missing In Heyholn

This is a DnD 5e one-shot for 2 sessions (around 16 hours).
Feel free to use it directly or for inspiration.

## Software

In order to receive best experience, we recommend the following software:
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) -- most of the notes are maintained with the tool and custom plugins are used for best DM experience.
* [KenkuFM](https://www.kenku.fm/) -- for copyright reasons there is no music in the repo, however, there are links to youtube you can use. Kenku is a soundboard that will allow you to use music with ease at your session.
